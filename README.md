# oneKB
My collection of small 1kb web-applications 

## Features and rules
* One file only
* Using web-technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, SVG etc.). File must be readable by web-browser.
* Volume of file must be 1024 bytes maximum (can be less).
* The display result should be interesting.

If need, result code save to two files: source file with readable text and 1kb file with simplified code. 

Folder with these files can have own "readme" file with descriptions.
